This solution will delete the url_path attribute of a product. It will then regenerate the url rewrites for the product.
In the case a product already has a url rewrite from the url_path to the product, then once the url rewrites are generated, the solution will add a redirect from the url_path to the url_key. This is to ensure that the url previously generated by url_path still works and gets redirected to the correct url.
