This test detects products without an associated website for a shop in single store mode. 

A product without a website is visible in the backend but will not be seen on the frontend. This issue is mostly seen when products have been imported via an importer like LitExtension.

It is not possible to manually fix this via Magento backend as the option to edit websites is not shown in single store mode on the product edit page.
